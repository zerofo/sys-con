# Troubleshooting guide

## My controller buttons are not mapped correctly
You need to map your buttons - Because there are thousands of controllers in the world, it's not possible for sys-con to map all of them.
This means, if you see that your controller works partially (stick/joystick works) but the buttons are not mapped correctly, you need to update the button mapping yourself.
See the [README](https://github.com/o0Zz/sys-con?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-a-controller) for more details.

## My controller right sticks axis are reversed. (X and Y are reversed)
If your right joystick doesn't behave as it should (for example, you press up and it goes right)
This means you need to map your joystick as well.
See the [README](https://github.com/o0Zz/sys-con?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-a-controller) 

And especially these 2 values:
```
[vid-pid]
right_stick_x=Z
right_stick_y=Rz
```
Where right_stick_x and right_stick_y could be: Z, -Z, Rz, -Rz, Rx, -Rx, Ry, -Ry (try all combinations to find the right one)

## My XBOX One S/X controller is not detected
This usually happens when you try to start the controller (press the XBOX button) when the USB is already connected to the switch.
Try the following procedure:
    1. Disconnect the controller from the switch
    2. Shut down the controller
    3. Power on the controller
    4. Connect the controller to the switch (make sure the switch is set to wake up).

## I got error: "Failed to acquire USB interface - Error: 0x25A8C ..."
This error occur when two drivers try to acquire the controller.
Most of the time, this issue occured when you plug an official switch controller and the switch itself try to open it.
To fix the problem:

1. Edit the `/config/sys-con/config.ini` and change `discovery_mode=0` to `discovery_mode=1`
2. Reboot the switch.

## My controller don't have Home or Capture button, how to simulate home or capture button ?
In the configuration file, edit your controller and add `simulate_home=` `simulate_capture=` followed by the buttons you want to use to simulate it.

Example:
```
[vid-pid]
simulate_home=minus+plus
simulate_capture=plus+L

[vid-pid]
simulate_home=plus+dpad_up
simulate_capture=plus+dpad_down
```

## My controller don't works at all
This probably means that your controller is not configure with the correct driver.
In the `/config/sys-con/config.ini`, you need to find your controller (\[VID/PID\]) and edit the `driver=` key with one of the following:
 - generic (default if nothing is set)
 - xbox360
 - xbox
 - xboxone
 - dualshock4

Typically, if you know your controller is an xboxone controller, just add
```
[vid-pid]
driver=xboxone
```

## My official Switch controller don't works when sys-con is enabled
This problem occurs because sys-con detects all connected USB devices and try to map them.
So you need to configure sys-con to detect only specific controllers.

1. Edit the `/config/sys-con/config.ini` and change `discovery_mode=0` to `discovery_mode=1`.
2. Update `discovery_vidpid=` to add the controllers you want to discover (Other than the official switch ones). 
3. Reboot the switch.

## My controller is not working or not discovered. I don't know what todo
Enable logs in Trace mode (https://github.com/o0Zz/sys-con?tab=readme-ov-file#logs) and looks at the logs.

A typically working flow will look like:

```

```

Search for logs starting with `|E|`, If you find one, this is an error and it might give you a hint about the issue.

## How to attach a logs to a ticket ?
- Edit `/config/sys-con/config.ini`
- change `log_level=2` to `log_level=0`
- Reboot your console
- Wait for the console to boot
- Connect your controllers
- Wait for the issue
- Download the logs from `/config/sys-con/log.log`
