# This script is used to simplify nintendo switch developement
# You need homebrew ftpd installed
# Boot the switch, enter in ftpd, use this script to do basic actions:
# "ftp upload" to upload the binary (You just built) directly to the switch
# "ftp logs" to display the logs
# Same commads are available with "sd", usefull when the nintendo switch crash on boot (You plug the sdcard to your laptop and debug from there)

# IP of your switch on your network:
FTP_URL=ftp://192.168.10.238:5000

#Below variable need to stay unchanged, they are correct whatever the developer
